    Preparation of Benzanilide from benzophenone
Aim : To prepare Benzanilide from benzophenone
Apparatus : RBF, funnel,watch-glass,condenser
Chemiclas required
    benzophenone,Hydroxl amine hydrochloride,NaOH pellets, ether,thionyl choloride
Procedure
    Step 1:
        Preparation of benzophenone oxime from benzophenone 
            2.5g of benzophenone was tken in RBF to which 1.5g of Hydroxl amine hydrochloride is added and 19 ml of EtOH and 1ml of water is adde d and to that
            2.85g of NaOH pellets are added and with the constant stirring and the flask was cooled as the temperature rises.It is attached to a reflux condenser and is 
            refluxed for 10-15 minutes.It is cooled and poured into the 3.5ml of conc.HCl in little of water.The solid was separated and dried.Small amount is used for 
            recrystallisation to check the melting point.

    Step 2 :    
        2g on benzophenoneoxime is taken in a small conical flask to which 20 ml of ether is addded, TO that, 3ml of thioyl chloride is added.The solvent will distill off
        on water bath.To that solution 30 ml of water is added and is boiled for several minutes.The supernatant liquidis decanted.The solid is dried and melting point is 
        obsereved.

Preparation of Benzilic acid from benzoin 
Aim: To prepare Benzilic acid from benzoin
Chemiclas required:benzoin,Conc.HNO3,KOH,alcohol, conc.HCl

Procedure
    Step 1: Preparation of benzyl from benzoin
        Place 2g of crude benzoin and 10 ml of conc HNO3.Reflux the reaction mixture using condenser until the solutionof N2 gas ceases for about 1.5 hours.Pour the reaction mixture
        into 300-400 ml of ice cold water.Stir well untill all crystallise completely as a yellow solid.Filter the crude benzil at the pump and wash it thoroughly with water
        to remove the nitric acid.Recrystallise from alcohol and determine the melting point.
    Step 2 : Preparation of benzillic acid from benzil
        In a 100ml RBF 2g if KOH pellets in 7ml of H20 and 7ml of rectified spirit and 3g of benzil was taken.A deep bluis-black solution was prepared.Reflux the reaction mixture
        using the condenser for 15 minutes.The contents are cooled.Potassium sakt if benzillic acid crystallises out.The contents are filtered,where the crystal of benzillic
        acid is formed in ice cold water.The Potassium salt is dissolved in about 35ml of water and conc. HCl was added with stirring until the solution is acidified.The solid 
        separated was filtered and thoroughly washed with water until the solid becomes free from chlorides Pale yellow coloure benzillic acid was thhen dried.
